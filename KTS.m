%% Replicate Hopp and Fuchs
% These reproduce figure 2b - simulates the data (sample_lds) and then perform inference on them.
%{
In these experiments, subjects had to make a 10 degree saccade (to a particular target),
but then (after 200 ‘practice’ trials) the target moves during the saccade.
Since saccades are too short to be able to use the feedback to adjust mid-saccade,
the subject can only adjust the gain on a trail by trial basis.
The subject eventually adapts by reducing the gain on the saccade (for an overshot).
Then at trial 1400, the target stops moving, and the subject adapts back to the original location.

%% Replicate Kojima faster second time

%{
Double adaptation experiments. Following an initial set of trials,
there is positive perturbation of the target by 35% for 800 trials,
followed by a 35% negative perturbation of the target (from the initial position).
This continues until the gain is back to neutral (i.e. the subject correctly saccades to the initial position),
at which time the target is (again) positively perturbed by 35%.
This second positive perturbation is followed by a quicker adaptation towards the new target position,
indicating that some memory remains of the previous positive perturbation.
