# MemoryKalman

Modified code from Kording, Tenembaum, and Shadmehr 2007, originally from:
http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v10/n6/suppinfo/nn1901_S1.html

For use for COSMO 2016 tutorials.

The code here has been edited with some added comments and some key sections removed.
COSMO attendees should download and work through this code, first fixing the Kalman_filter.m to create
this figure

then go to the KTS.m file and reproduce the figures from the original paper.
